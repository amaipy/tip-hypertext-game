# tip-hypertext-game
A hypertext game in [Twine/Twee](https://twinery.org/) and HTML + CSS, compiled with [Tweego](https://github.com/tmedwards/tweego).

Created to be part of [The Interactive Project](https://sites.google.com/ualberta.ca/tips-interactive-project/) Station #3 [(Hypertext)](https://sites.google.com/ualberta.ca/tips-interactive-project/home/the-interactive-game/hypertext).

## The Interactive Project

Interactivity is commonly recognized as an important feature of contemporary games and media, but its roles in older modes of communication and its potential as an exploratory tool are not widely understood. Under the direction of Chris Reyns-Chikuma (MLCS), Astrid Ensslin (MLCS-HC) and Walter Davis (EASIA), sponsored by SSHRC and KIAS, and in collaboration with the Faculty of Arts, the Faculty of Education, and several Departments, the Interactive Project (TIP) proposes that interactivity should be both a subject of investigation and a means of generating new understanding. During a 5-week (Sept.27 -Oct.29, 2021) cross-disciplinary event, the project will bring scholars, creators, students, and the general public together to explore the complex ways in which interactivity has articulated human experience throughout our history and continues to do so today. 

## Hypertext

In the 1970s-80s, hypertext was a revolutionary technology that connected ideas to contextual material. However, hypertext was preceded by various interactive means, including philosophical constructions (I Ching, Kabbalah), numerous improvements to the use of the book (table of contents, index …), and poetic experiments such as Raymond Queneau’s Cent mille milliards de poèmes (A Hundred Thousand Billion Poems; available here in Rutherford special collection). 
Hypertext is now integral to an interactive activity used every day by everyone on the web. It also provides the fundamental structure to interactive games and stories - linking the narrative to insightful information.
